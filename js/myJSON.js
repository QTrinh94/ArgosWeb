At the moment they're pimping the new Marvin's iMagic Tin of Tricks. It comes with some props and a code to activate their app, and you interect with your iOS or Android device to do various 'tricks'. This may be more entertaining for the youngsters with their xmas tablets and devices as some of the tricks are a bit gimmicky at least, but the card tricks they showed us in shop made us want to get hold of one.\n\nIn Hamley's though the Tin of Tricks is \u00c2\u00a335, so obviously we weren't going to pay that, so I had a look when we got home. The Tin of Tricks seems to be a Hamley's 'exclusive' for now which I can't find many details on, but the deal posted here is essentialy the same not 'limited edition' version, with the only difference being that the ltd Tin get a D'lite morph included, which I've not a huge craving for, and maybe this one includes the book and the tin doesn't? Not sure about that but this box is much larger than the tin version\n\nThis usually retails over \u00c2\u00a320 from what I can tell, rrp \u00c2\u00a325 and currently \u00c2\u00a322.99 on Amazon, so for \u00c2\u00a39.99 at Argos it's a bargain for the set, and also was available at every store I checked in London and Kent.
